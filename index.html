        <p>Welcome to my page about the classic vintage keyboard Juno-60 made by Roland in 1982.
            I've been collecting synthesizers since 1974 but I have to admit that this is my favourite. It's simplicity and beautiful sound is hard to beat.

        <p>Among the first in Roland's amazing Juno family! Six analog voices of polyphony and patch memory storage!! 
        <br><br> The Juno-60 sounds great, however, like the Juno-6 it lacks MIDI control. 
        <br><br> The Juno-60 includes 56 patches of memory storage. The Juno-60 is still popular due in part to opinions that it sounds better (punchier) than the Juno-106. The Juno-6 and 60 are very rich sounding synthesizers and are great analog machines as long as you can withstand the absence of MIDI control. 
        <br><br> The JSQ-60 sequencer is an external sequencer controller for the Juno-60 and is usually worth acquiring. Of course nobody can deny that the wooden side panel look is a true sign of Vintage status! 
        <br><br> Junos have been used by Enya, The Cure, Sean Lennon, Faithless, Astral Projection, Vince Clarke, Rabbit in the Moon, Men at Work, Flock of Seagulls, Olive, Dee-Lite, Howard Jones, Locust, Eurythmics and Add N to (X).</p>
